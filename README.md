# 🧠 Parkinson's Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the presence of **Parkinson’s disease** using machine learning algorithms trained on biomedical voice measurements. Parkinson’s is a chronic and progressive neurological disorder, and early detection can significantly improve quality of life. This model helps support early diagnosis through voice-based data.

📁 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** and contains biomedical voice measurements from 31 individuals, 23 of whom had Parkinson’s disease. It includes 22 features extracted from voice recordings.

🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

The following ML models are implemented and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree Classifier

🔍 Key Features

- 🔬 **Biomedical Signal Processing**: Uses vocal features like jitter, shimmer, and harmonic-to-noise ratio.
- ⚙️ **Preprocessing**: Feature scaling and label encoding.
- 📊 **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report.
- ✅ **Model Selection**: Best model identified based on performance metrics.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📈 Results

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier showed the best performance with a high accuracy rate, making it a suitable model for this classification task.
